			<p>My name is Rahul Katara. I belongs to Bharatpur,Rajasthan. I am currently a<B> B.Tech,CSE student of IIT ROORKEE</B>.I belongs to a middle-class family. My father is a govt. teacher. My mother is a house-maker. My younger sister is currently preparing for NEET 2020. </p>

			<p>I received my secondary education at Model Public Secondary School where I gained a lot of knowledge and creativity. I had a great memories of my school as I read in it since my firt class to 10th. I got 98% marks in class 10th in 2015-16 and secured <B>6th State Merit and 3rd District Merit</B>.I also got 92% marks in 12th.</p>

			<p> After joining Vibrant,Kota in class 11, my journey of IIT-JEE began. I had a great time in Kota as first time in my life, I felt a really hard competition there. I developed myself so as to compete with other brilliant students. I also faced depression during this period and also learn how to get over it. I got 3736 rank in JEE Advanced 2018 which was not so good as per my expectation. So, I took drop and attemted again for JEE by enrolling in Resonance,Kota. And this time, I secured <B>AIR 361 </B>and took admission in IIT ROORKEE in CSE branch. </p>
