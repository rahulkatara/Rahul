			<dt><a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a></dt>

			<dt><a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></dt>
				 <p>Codecademy is an online interactive platform that offers free coding classes in 12 different programming languages including Python, Java, JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS, React.js), Ruby, SQL, C++, and Sass, as well as markup languages HTML and CSS.

			<dt><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org">GeeksForGeeks</a></dt>
				<p>Acoording to me GeeksforGeeks is the best site to learn coding and concepts of programming languages.

I have calculated all programs and problems which are on GeeksforGeeks.

If you want to learn Data Structures - GeeksforGeeks there are total 1168 questions on Data structure.

If you want to learn Algorithms - GeeksforGeeks there are 378 problems.

I think if any one practice only 10 questions everyday then he/she will be master after 4.5 months in computer science.

Because when when you will start doing code and learning all questions which are given on GeeksforGeeks it will take 4 months and 15 days if you learn continuously 10 question per day.</p>
