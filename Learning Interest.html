		<h5>Languages: Java, Python, c++</h5>
		<p>Competitive programming is solving well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified limits.<br/>

		Based on the above definition, competitive programming has three aspects:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Well-defined problems: You are presented with one or more problems. The problem statement contains variables, and you have to be able to answer the problem if given any possible combination of values of the variables. The problem will be well-defined: you will be informed the exact constraints of all variables, any necessary assumptions, etc.</li>
		<li>Computer programs: You write computer programs that solve the problems. Note that the "computer program" here is a very simple command-line program; no fancy GUI or web app etc. The command-line program reads the values of the variables from the standard input, and must write the answer to the standard output.</li>
		<li>Specified limits: Your program must run and produce the answer within a specified time and memory limit. Also, you must write the programs in a specified set of allowed programming languages.</li>
		</ul> <p><br/><br/></p>

		<h5>Languages: HTML, CSS, Java-Script</h5>
		<p>Web development largely denotes to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet and internet. The web development process comprises of Web design, Web content and network configuration amongst other tasks.</p>
		<ul>
		<li> Web Design: In simpler words, it is the process of gathering ideas and artistically arranging and executing them by certain principles for a detailed purpose. It is the parallel process of creation with the intention of presenting the content on electronic web pages.</li>
		<li>Web Content: Web content is one of the main reasons that individuals come to your webpage. Basically, it is the textual-visual content that runs as a part of user experience on the website. It includes Images, Sounds, Videos and Animations as well.</li>
		<li>Network Configuration: Network Configuration is the method of shaping and continuing information about all the modules of a computer network. This configuration comprises the location and network address of all hardware devices following up with the material about the programs.</li>
		</ul> <p><br/><br/></p>

		<h5>Languages: Python, R</h5>
		<p>Machine Learning is an extensively algorithm driven study which makes computer software capable of learning on the basis of their own previous experience and improve the performance of a task. It also gives software ability to analyze, predict and sort huge amounts of data. Some of its applications are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> With the newly added ability to the computers of analyzing data based on some logic, Businesses could predict the upcoming events like growth, market value, employee productivity.</li>
		<li>It also save companies a lot of money due to reduced errors as machines is not prone to make errors that humans make.</li>
		<li>Well, Ml algorithms have been proven to be of use in detecting and diagnosing cancer. An early detection of Melanoma would increase the survival rate.</li>
		</ul> <p><br/><br/></p>

		<h5>Languages: Python, R</h5>
		<p>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.<br/>

Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized. The core applications of artificial intelligence includes:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> Machine perception deals with the capability to use sensory inputs to deduce the different aspects of the world, while computer vision is the power to analyze visual inputs with a few sub-problems such as facial, object and gesture recognition.</li>
		<li>Robotics is also a major field related to AI. Robots require intelligence to handle tasks such as object manipulation and navigation, along with sub-problems of localization, motion planning and mapping.</li>
		<li>Traffic Control, Automating Support, Automating Manufacturing, Fraud Detection, Imposing Laws without corruption etc.</li>
		</ul> <p><br/><br/></p>
